## About git

## Kinds of version control

- local version control  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- centralised version control  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - perforce
  - CVS
  - Subversion
- distributed version control  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Git
  - Mercurial
  - DARCS

## Key requirements when developing GIT

- Speed
- Simple design
- Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
- Fully distributed
- Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)

## Traditional VCSses store diferences
CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on

## Other advantages of git
- Nearly everything is local
- Git Has Integrity
  - corruption detected immediately
  - Everything is referenced by SHA1-hashes of contents
- Git almost exclusively adds data
  - Once you commit it very difficult to lose code
